All code used from other sources are referenced in respective notebooks.

`MNIST-dataset.ipynb` contains the code that trained the model with an [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist), and `custom-dataset.ipynb` has the code where the custom images were collected, processed and trained the CNN.
<br>
Finally, `model-testing.ipynb` simply loads the model and uses OpenCV to generate unlabelled images and test the model.
